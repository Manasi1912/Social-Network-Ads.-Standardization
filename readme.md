# Social Network Ads - Data Standardization

This project demonstrates **data preprocessing** and **standardization** on the popular **Social Network Ads** dataset using Python and pandas.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to apply standardization (also known as feature scaling) to the input features of the dataset. This is a common preprocessing step in machine learning that brings all features onto a similar scale, which is especially useful for algorithms that rely on distance metrics (like SVM, KNN, or logistic regression).
